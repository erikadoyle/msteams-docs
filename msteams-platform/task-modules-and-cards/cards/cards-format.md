# Format cards in Microsoft Teams

Following are the two ways to add rich text formatting to your cards:

* [Markdown](#format-cards-with-markdown)
* [HTML](#format-cards-with-html)

Cards support formatting in the text property only, not in the title or subtitle properties. Formatting can be specified using a subset of XML or HTML formatting or Markdown, depending on the card type. For current and future development of Adaptive Cards, Markdown formatting is recommended.

Formatting support differs between card types. Rendering of the card can differ slightly between the desktop and the mobile Microsoft Teams clients, and Teams in the desktop browser.

You can include an inline image with any Teams card. Supported image formats are .png, .jpg, or .gif formats. Keep the dimensions within 1024 x 1024 pixels and file size less than 1 MB. Animated .gif images aren't supported. For more information, see [types of cards](./cards-reference.md#inline-card-images).

You can format Adaptive Cards and connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups with Markdown that include certain supported styles.

## Format cards with Markdown

The following card types support Markdown formatting in Teams:

* Adaptive Cards: Markdown is supported in Adaptive Card `Textblock` field, and `Fact.Title` and `Fact.Value`. HTML isn't supported in Adaptive Cards.
* Connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups: Markdown and limited HTML is supported in connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups in the text fields.

> [!NOTE]
> Markdown isn't supported for OAuth sign in cards in bots.

You can use newlines for Adaptive Cards using `\r` or `\n` escape sequences for newlines in lists. Formatting is different between the desktop and the mobile versions of Teams for Adaptive Cards. Card-based mentions are supported in web, desktop, and mobile clients. You can use the information masking property to mask specific information, such as password or sensitive information from users within the Adaptive Card `Input.Text` input element. You can expand the width of an Adaptive Card using the `width` object. You can enable typeahead support within Adaptive Cards and filter the set of input choices as the user types the input. You can use the `msteams` property to add the ability to display images in Stage View selectively.

Formatting is different between the desktop and the mobile versions of Teams for Adaptive Cards and connector cards. In this section, you can go through the Markdown format example for Adaptive Cards and connector cards.

# [Markdown format for Adaptive Cards](#tab/adaptive-md)

 The following table provides the supported styles for `Textblock`, `Fact.Title`, and `Fact.Value`:

| Style | Example | Markdown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bold | **Bold** | ```**Bold**``` |
| Italic | _Italic_ | ```_Italic_``` |
| Unordered list | <ul><li>text</li><li>text</li></ul> | ```- Item 1\r- Item 2\r- Item 3``` |
| Ordered list | <ol><li>text</li><li>text</li></ol> | ```1. Green\r2. Orange\r3. Blue``` |
| Hyperlinks |[Bing](https://www.bing.com/)| ```[Title](url)``` |

The following Markdown tags aren't supported:

* Headers
* Tables
* Images
* Preformatted text
* Blockquotes

### Newlines for Adaptive Cards

You can use the `\r` or `\n` escape sequences for newlines in lists. Using `\n\n` in lists causes the next element in the list to be indented. If you require newlines elsewhere in the TextBlock, use `\n\n`.

### Mobile and desktop differences for Adaptive Cards

On the desktop, Adaptive Card Markdown formatting appears as shown in the following image in both web browsers and in the Teams client application:

> [!NOTE]
> The date and localization features mentioned in this section aren't supported in Teams.

### Adaptive Cards format sample

The following code shows an example of Adaptive Cards formatting:

``` json
{
    "$schema": "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.0",
    "body": [
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "This is some **bold** text"
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "This is some _italic_ text"
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "- Bullet \r- List \r",
            "wrap": true
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "1. Numbered\r2. List\r",
            "wrap": true
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Check out [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io)"
        }
    ]
}
```

Adaptive Cards support emoji. The following code shows an example of Adaptive Cards with an emoji:

``` json
{ "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json", "type": "AdaptiveCard", "version": "1.0", "body": [ { "type": "Container", "items": [ { "type": "TextBlock", "text": "Publish Adaptive Card with emojis ðŸ¥° ", "weight": "bolder", "size": "medium" }, ] }, ], }
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using REST APIs, then set `charset=UTF-8` in your request headers to add emojis in Adaptive Cards.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/adaptive-card-emoji.png" alt-text="Adaptive card emoji":::

### Mention support within Adaptive Cards

You can add @mentions within an Adaptive Card body for bots and message extension responses. To add @mentions in cards, follow the same notification logic and rendering as that of message based [mentions in channel and group chat conversations](../../bots/how-to/conversations/channel-and-group-conversations.md#work-with-mentions).

Bots and message extensions can include mentions within the card content in [TextBlock](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/TextBlock.html) and [FactSet](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/FactSet.html) elements.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * [Media elements](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Media.html) are currently not supported in Adaptive Cards on Teams platform.
> * Channel and team mentions aren't supported in bot messages.
> * You can @mention multiple users in a single Adaptive Card message, however, ensure that the message size limit doesn't exceed 28 KB for [Incoming Webhooks](~/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook.md) and 40 KB for a [bot message](~/bots/how-to/format-your-bot-messages.md).

To include a mention in an Adaptive Card, your app needs to include the following elements:

* `<at>username</at>` in the supported Adaptive Card elements.
* The `mention` object inside of an `msteams` property in the card content includes the Teams user ID of the user being mentioned.
* The `userId` is unique to your bot ID and a particular user. It can be used to @mention a particular user. The `userId` can be retrieved using one of the options mentioned in [get the user ID](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/conversations/send-proactive-messages?tabs=dotnet#get-the-user-id-team-id-or-channel-id).

#### Sample Adaptive Card with a mention

The following code shows an example of Adaptive Card with a mention:

``` json
{
  "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
  "content": {
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "body": [
      {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "Hi <at>John Doe</at>"
      }
    ],
    "$schema": "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "version": "1.0",
    "msteams": {
      "entities": [
        {
          "type": "mention",
          "text": "<at>John Doe</at>",
          "mentioned": {
            "id": "29:123124124124",
            "name": "John Doe"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<a name='microsoft-azure-active-directory-azure-ad-object-id-and-upn-in-user-mention'></a>

### Microsoft Entra Object ID and UPN in user mention

Teams platform allows to mention users with their Microsoft Entra Object ID and User Principle Name (UPN), in addition to the existing mention IDs. Bots with Adaptive Cards and Connectors with Incoming Webhooks support the two user mention IDs.

The following table describes the newly supported user mention IDs:

|IDs  | Supporting capabilities | Description | Example |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| Microsoft Entra Object ID | Bot, Connector |  Microsoft Entra userâ€™s Object ID | 49c4641c-ab91-4248-aebb-6a7de286397b |
| UPN | Bot, Connector | Microsoft Entra userâ€™s UPN | `john.smith@microsoft.com` |

#### User mention in bots with Adaptive Cards

Bots support user mention with the Microsoft Entra Object ID and UPN, in addition to the existing IDs. The support for two new IDs is available in bots for text messages, Adaptive Cards body, and message extension response. Bots support the mention IDs in conversation and `invoke` scenarios. The user gets activity feed notification when being @mentioned with the IDs.

> [!NOTE]
> Schema update and UI/UX changes aren't required for user mentions with Adaptive Cards in Bot.

##### Example

Example for user mention in bots with Adaptive Cards as follows:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "version": "1.0",
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "Hi <at>Adele UPN</at>, <at>Adele Azure AD</at>"
    }
  ],
  "msteams": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "type": "mention",
        "text": "<at>Adele UPN</at>",
        "mentioned": {
          "id": "AdeleV@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
          "name": "Adele Vance"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "mention",
        "text": "<at>Adele Azure AD</at>",
        "mentioned": {
          "id": "87d349ed-44d7-43e1-9a83-5f2406dee5bd",
          "name": "Adele Vance"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### User mention in Incoming Webhook with Adaptive Cards

Incoming webhooks start to support user mention in Adaptive Cards with the Microsoft Entra Object ID and UPN.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Enable user mention in the schema for Incoming webhooks to support Microsoft Entra Object ID and UPN.
> * UI/UX changes aren't required for user mentions with Microsoft Entra Object ID and UPN.

##### Example

Example for user mention in Incoming Webhook as follows:

```json
{
    "type": "message",
    "attachments": [
        {
        "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
        "content": {
            "type": "AdaptiveCard",
            "body": [
                {
                    "type": "TextBlock",
                    "size": "Medium",
                    "weight": "Bolder",
                    "text": "Sample Adaptive Card with User Mention"
                },
                {
                    "type": "TextBlock",
                    "text": "Hi <at>Adele UPN</at>, <at>Adele Azure AD</at>"
                }
            ],
            "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
            "version": "1.0",
            "msteams": {
                "entities": [
                    {
                        "type": "mention",
                        "text": "<at>Adele UPN</at>",
                        "mentioned": {
                          "id": "AdeleV@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
                          "name": "Adele Vance"
                        }
                      },
                      {
                        "type": "mention",
                        "text": "<at>Adele Azure AD</at>",
                        "mentioned": {
                          "id": "87d349ed-44d7-43e1-9a83-5f2406dee5bd",
                          "name": "Adele Vance"
                        }
                      }
                ]
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

### People icon in an Adaptive Card

People icon helps users to view the images of users in an Adaptive Card. You can insert an image and apply all the properties supported on images.

There are two types of people icons that are supported in an Adaptive Card:

* Persona: If you want to show a single user in an Adaptive Card, the Adaptive Card displays the people icon and the name of the user.

    The following is a JSON example of a Persona card:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
      "type": "AdaptiveCard",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "body": [
    {
          "type": "TextBlock",
          "text": "Persona",
          "weight": "bolder"
        },
        {
          "type": "Component",
          "name": "graph.microsoft.com/user",
          "view": "compact",
          "properties": {
            "id": "65f50003-e15d-434a-9e14-0fcfeb3d7817",
            "displayName": "Daniela Mandera",
            "userPrincipalName": "damandera@microsoft.com"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

* Persona Set: If you want to show multiple users in an Adaptive Card, the Adaptive Card displays only the people icon of the users.

    The following is a JSON example of a Persona Set:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
      "type": "AdaptiveCard",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "body": [
        {
          "type": "TextBlock",
          "text": "Persona Set",
          "weight": "bolder"
        },
        {
          "type": "Component",
          "name": "graph.microsoft.com/users",
          "view": "compact",
          "properties": {
            "users": [
              {
                "id": "65f50003-e15d-434a-9e14-0fcfeb3d7817",
                "displayName": "Daniela Mandera",
                "userPrincipalName": "damandera@microsoft.com"
              },
              {
                "id": "65f50003-e15d-434a-9e14-0fcfeb3d7817",
                "displayName": "Daniela Mandera",
                "userPrincipalName": "damandera@microsoft.com"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can't customize the style of the Persona and Persona Set in an Adaptive Card.

The following image is an example of the people icon in an Adaptive Card:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/adaptive-cards/people-icon-persona-persona-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of the persona and persona set type people icon in an Adaptive Card.":::

#### Query parameters

The following table lists the query parameters:

|Property name  |description  |
|---------|---------|
|`type`     |    `component`     |
|`name`     |   `graph.microsoft.com/users`. Search all members across the organization.      |
|`view`     |   `compact`      |
|`properties`|Passed to the component template|
|`id`     | User's MRI  |
|`displayName`     |   Name of the user     |
|`userPrincipalName`|The user's principal name of the account in Microsoft Entra ID|

Adaptive Components are high-level components powered by [templating](/adaptive-cards/templating/) and native Adaptive Card elements. The type `component` can be used anywhere inside the card body and the component data is defined in the `properties` attribute.  The component data under `properties` is passed directly to the component. The `properties` property defines the format for Persona and Persona Set and all other  properties under `properties` is ignored by `component` type in the Adaptive Card schema.

Your bot can query for the list of members and their basic user profiles, including Teams user IDs and Microsoft Entra information, such as `name`, `id` and `userPrincipalName`. For more information, see [Fetch the roster or user profile](../../bots/how-to/get-teams-context.md#fetch-the-roster-or-user-profile).

The following is an example of the people icon in an Adaptive Card on Teams desktop and mobile clients:

**Desktop client**:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/adaptive-cards/people-icon-persona-persona-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a persona and persona set icons in an Adaptive Card in Teams desktop client.":::

When a user hovers on a people icon, the people card of that user is displayed.

**Mobile client**

:::row:::

:::column:::
  :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/adaptive-cards/people-icon-mobile-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of people icon in a persona and persona set in Teams mobile client.":::
:::column-end:::
:::column:::
  :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/adaptive-cards/people-icon-mobile-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of people icon in a persona and persona set in Teams mobile.":::
:::column-end:::

:::row-end:::

When a user selects a people icon, it displays the people card of that user.

### Information masking in Adaptive Cards

Use the information masking property to mask specific information, such as password or sensitive information from users within the Adaptive Card [`Input.Text`](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Input.Text.html) input element.

> [!NOTE]
> The feature only supports client side information masking. The masked input text is sent as clear text to the HTTPS endpoint address that was specified during [bot configuration](../../build-your-first-app/build-bot.md#4-register-your-bot-endpoint).

To mask information in Adaptive Cards, add the `style` property to **type** `input.text`, and set its value to **Password**.

#### Sample Adaptive Card with masking property

The following code shows an example of Adaptive Card with masking property:

```json
{
    "type": "Input.Text",
    "id": "secretThing",
    "style": "password",
},
```

The following image is an example of masking information in Adaptive Cards:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/masking-information-view.png" alt-text="Masking information view":::

### Full width Adaptive Card

You can use the `msteams` property to expand the width of an Adaptive Card and make use of additional canvas space. The next section provides information on how to use the property.

> [!NOTE]
> Test your full width Adaptive Card in narrow form factors such as mobile and meeting side panels to ensure that content is not truncated.

#### Construct full width cards

To make a full width Adaptive Card, the `width` object in `msteams` property in the card content must be set to `Full`.

#### Sample Adaptive Card with full width

To make a full width Adaptive Card, your app must include the elements from the following code sample:

``` json
{
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "body": [{
        "type": "Container",
        "items": [{
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Digest card",
            "size": "Large",
            "weight": "Bolder"
        }]
    }],

    "msteams": {
        "width": "Full"
    },
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "version": "1.2"
}
```

The following image shows a full width Adaptive Card:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/full-width-adaptive-card.png" alt-text="Full width Adaptive Card view":::

The following image shows the default view of the Adaptive Card when you have not set the `width` property to **Full**:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/small-width-adaptive-card.png" alt-text="Small width Adaptive Card view":::

### Typeahead support

Within the [`Input.Choiceset`](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Input.ChoiceSet.html) schema element, asking users to filter and select a sizeable number of choices can significantly slow down task completion. Typeahead support within Adaptive Cards can simplify input selection by narrowing or filtering the set of input choices as the user types the input.

To enable typeahead within the `Input.Choiceset`, set `style` to `filtered` and ensure `isMultiSelect` is set to `false`.

#### Sample Adaptive Card with typeahead support

The following code shows an example of Adaptive Card with typeahead support:

``` json
{
   "type": "Input.ChoiceSet",
   "label": "Select a user",
   "isMultiSelect": false,
   "choices":  [
      { "title": "User 1", "value": "User1" },
      { "title": "User 2", "value": "User2" }
    ],
   "style": "filtered"
}
```

### Stage View for images in Adaptive Cards

In an Adaptive Card, you can use the `msteams` property to add the ability to display images in Stage View selectively. When users hover over the images, they can see an expand icon, for which the `allowExpand` attribute is set to `true`. The following is an example of the `msteams` property:

``` json
{
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
     "body": [
          {
            "type": "Image",
            "url": "https://picsum.photos/200/200?image=110",
            "msTeams": {
              "allowExpand": true
            }
          }
     ],
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "version": "1.2"
}
```

When users hover over the image, an expand icon appears at the upper-right corner as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/adaptivecard-hover-expand-icon.png" alt-text="Adaptive Card with expandable image":::

The image appears in Stage View when the user selects the expand icon as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/adaptivecard-expand-image.png" alt-text="Image expanded to Stage View":::

In the Stage View, users can zoom in and zoom out of the image. You can select the images in your Adaptive Card that must have this capability.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Zoom in and zoom out capability applies only to the image elements that is image type in an Adaptive Card.
> * For Teams mobile apps, Stage View functionality for images in Adaptive Cards is available by default. Users can view Adaptive Card images in Stage View by simply tapping on the image, irrespective of whether the `allowExpand` attribute is present or not.
> * Stage View for images in Adaptive Cards doesn't support Base64 encoded images.

# [Markdown format for connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups](#tab/connector-md)

Connector cards support limited Markdown and HTML formatting.

| Style | Example | Markdown |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Adaptive Cards overflow menu

Adaptive Card in Teams supports overflow menu. You can populate an overflow menu for all the secondary actions in an Adaptive Card. An overflow menu in an Adaptive Card can be added to the following:

* [Actions](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/ActionSet.html): In actions, the primary buttons appear on the Adaptive Card and the secondary buttons are inside the overflow menu.

* [ActionSet](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/ActionSet.html): ActionSet is a combination of multiple actions in an Adaptive Card. Each action set can have an overflow menu.

> [!NOTE]
> An Adaptive Card supports up to six primary actions to be viewed on the card. Any additional primary action is viewed in the overflow menu.

  :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/overflow-menu-gif.gif" alt-text="GIF shows the overflow menu experience in an Adaptive Card.":::

### Enable overflow menu

To enable overflow menu, configure the `mode` property with the value as `primary` or `secondary` in the Adaptive Card schema. The following table describes the `mode` property:

|Property|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`mode`| Enum (Primary, Secondary) |No |Whether or not the action is a primary or secondary action. Secondary actions will be collapsed into an overflow menu.|

The following is an example of the `mode` property in the `actions` type and the `ActionSet` element:

**Actions**

In the following example, there are two primary actions and one secondary action. The secondary action creates an overflow menu.

```json
{
   "type": "AdaptiveCard",
   "actions": [
        {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Set due date"
        },
        {
            "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
            "title": "View",
            "url": "https://adaptivecards.io"
        },
        {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Delete",
            "mode": "secondary"
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The overflow menu behaves differently on a bot sent card and a message extension card for the root level `actions` in an Adaptive Card. The overflow menu on a bot sent card appears as a pop-up context menu and on the message extension card it appears at the upper-right corner under the More options (**...**) icon. The behavior is not applicable to the `ActionSet` in an Adaptive Card.

The following image is an example of overflow menu in a bot sent card and a message extension card:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/overflow-menu-card-beahvior.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of the overflow menu behavior in a bot sent card and a messaging extension card.":::

**Action set**

In the following example, all the actions are marked as secondary, therefore, a single overflow menu appears on the card.

``` json
{
    "type": "ActionSet",
     "actions": [

          {
           
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "view",
            "mode": "Secondary" 
       {
       },
            "type": "Action.submit",
            "title": "Delete",
            "mode": "secondary"

       },
       {
             "type": "Action.submit",
            "title": "Delete",
            "mode": "secondary"
       }
     ]
}
```

The following is an example of the overflow menu experience in Teams desktop and mobile:

# [Desktop](#tab/desktop)

When a user selects the overflow menu on a desktop, the buttons that are set as secondary appear in the Adaptive Card.

  :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/desktop-overflow-image-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of buttons in an Adaptive Card on Teams desktop.":::

  :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/desktop-overflow-image-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of an Adaptive Card with the list of actions in an overflow menu on Teams desktop.":::
  
  :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/desktop-overflow-menu-image-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of an Adaptive Card with the buttons that are set as secondary as options in an overflow menu on Teams desktop.":::

# [Mobile](#tab/mobile)

When a user selects the overflow menu on mobile, the Adaptive Card displays the buttons that are defined. There's an integrated sheet that displays an overflow menu with card related tasks with a message option. A long press on any message displays a list of related messages. This option is available only for actions.

Character formatting, such as bold and italic displays correctly on Android.

### Format example for simple cards

The images in the previous section were created using Teams **App Studio**, where the text property of a hero card is set to the following string:

`<p>bold: <strong>Bold Text</strong></p><p>italic: <em>Italic Text</em></p><p>strikethrough: <strike>Strikethrough text</strike></p><h1>Header 1</h1><h2>Header 2</h2><h3>Header 3</h3><p>bullet list: <ul><li>text</li><li>text</li></ul></p><p>ordered list: <ol><li>text</li><li>text</li></ol></p><pre>preformatted text</pre><blockquote>blockquote text</blockquote></p><p>hyperlink: <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/\">Bing</a></p><p>embedded image: <img src=\"https://aka.ms/Fo983c\" alt=\"Duck on a rock\"></img></p>`

You can test formatting in your own cards by modifying this code.
