   ## Get a free Azure account

   If you want to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

   Now you've got all the tools to set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to create first.

- title: Create project workspace for your message extension app
  durationInMinutes: 1

    You've built your bot app. Now, let's create your first message extension app.

    Message Extension capability lets you interact with a web service. Use the compose area, command box, or a messaging in Teams client to search and initiate actions in an external system.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/your-helloworld-app-msgext.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. message extension is highlighted.":::

    There are two types of Teams **message extensions**:

    - [Search commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command.md): You can search external systems. Then, you can insert its results into a message in the form of a card.
    - [Action commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command.md): You can present your users with a modal pop-up to collect or display information. Then, you can process their interaction and send information back to Teams.

    Let's create a message extension app with a *search command*. Use it to search for external data and insert the results into a message within Teams client.

    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the message extension app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Message extensions rely on bots to provide a dialog between the user and your code.

    ## Take a tour of the message extension app source code

    A message extension uses the Bot Framework. You use it to interact with your service via a conversation. After scaffolding is done, view the project directories and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/folder-structure-mex-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the folder msg.":::

    | Folder / File | Contents |
    | --- | --- |
    | `teamsapp.yml` | Main project file describes your application configuration and defines the set of actions to run in each lifecycle stages. |
    | `teamsapp.local.yml` | This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging. |
    | `.vscode/` | VSCode files for local debug. |
    | `appPackage/` | Templates for the Teams application manifest. |
    | `infra/` | Templates for provisioning Azure resources. |
    | `index.js` | Application entry point and `restify` handler. |
    | `teamsBot.js` | Teams activity handler. |

    > [!Tip]

        > [!NOTE]
        > When you run the app for the first time, all dependencies are downloaded, and the app is built. A browser window opens when the build is complete. This process can take three to five minutes to complete.

        Teams runs your app in a web browser.
        
    1. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account, if prompted.
    1. Select **Add** to add the app to your account.
    
        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/add-mex-app-local-debug-latest.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows message to add the app." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/add-mex-app-local-debug.png":::

        The toolkit displays a message to indicate that the app is added to Teams.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/mex-added-local-debug.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows message to try the app now or later.":::
 
        - If you select **Got it**, you can try the app later from the list of uploaded custom apps.
        - If you select **Try it**, Teams loads your app.

    1. Select **Try it**.

        The Message Extension app is loaded in a chat bot app.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2//first-msgext/app-added-mex-local-debug.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows that custom app uploaded in Teams." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2//first-msgext/app-added-mex-local-debug.png":::

        As message extension apps rely on bots for enabling communication between the user and the web service,, your app loads in to a chat feature of a bot.

        - If you've created a bot app before you created the message extension app, you can see that it's loaded in the same bot app you created. Previous chat messages are visible.
        - If you created a message extension first, your app is loaded in any chat that is open on Teams.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you want to extend your app to Outlook and Microsoft 365, you can choose to debug your app with Outlook and Microsoft 365 from RUN AND DEBUG dropdown in Visual Studio Code.

    ### Test your app

    The first time your app loads, the message extension app is open for you to test. This sample app lets you search open-source npm packages from the software registry.
    
    #### To run a search query

    1. Let's enter a search string in the search box, such as "cli". You'll get a list of the matching items:

      Before deployment, the application has been running locally:

      * The backend runs using **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
      * The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

      Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription, and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code for the application to Azure.

      * The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services, including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
      * The frontend application is deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.
