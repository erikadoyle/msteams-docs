# Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Overview

::: zone pivot="visual-studio-v17-7"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We've introduced the important changes in Teams Toolkit extension within Microsoft Visual Studio v17.7 with many new app development features. We recommend that you use Teams Toolkit v17.7 for building your Teams app.

Teams Toolkit makes it simple to get started with app development for Microsoft Teams using Visual Studio.

* Start with a project template for common custom app built for your org (LOB app) scenarios or from a sample.
* Save setup time with automated app registration and configuration.
* Run and debug to Teams directly from familiar tools.
* Smart defaults for hosting in Microsoft Azure using infrastructure-as-code and Bicep.
* Bring your app to your organization or the Microsoft Teams Store using built-in publishing tools.

### Project templates

You can start with the capability-focused templates such as tabs, bots, and message extensions or by following the existing samples if you're already familiar with Teams app development. Teams Toolkit reduces the complexity of getting started with the help of templates for custom app built for org scenarios and smart defaults to accelerate your time to production.

Perform the following the steps to select templates and app capbaility:

1. Select **File > New > Project**.

1. Enter **Teams** in the search box and from search results, select **Microsoft Teams App** template.

### Automatic registration and configuration

You can save time and let the toolkit automatically register the app in Teams Developer Portal. When you first run or debug the app, Teams Toolkit automatically registers the Teams app to your Microsoft 365 tenant and configures settings such as Microsoft Entra ID for your Teams app. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account to control where the app is configured and customize the Microsoft Entra manifest.
