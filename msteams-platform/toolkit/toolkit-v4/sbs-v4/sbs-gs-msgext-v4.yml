   ## Prepare development environment

   After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.


   ### Install the Teams Toolkit

   The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams Store, and more. 
    
   You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, or CLI (command-line interface), called `TeamsFx`.


   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

   1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
   1. In the search box, enter **Teams toolkit**.
   1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

    :::image type="content" source="~/toolkit/toolkit-v4/sbs-v4/images-sbs/sbs-gs-msgext/install-toolkit-vscodeversion-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams Toolkit extension installation.":::

    The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar** after it's installed.

    :::image type="content" source="~/toolkit/toolkit-v4/sbs-v4/images-sbs/sbs-gs-msgext/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon-v4.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar.":::

   You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The latest version of Teams Toolkit is 4.2.0.
   
   # [Command line](#tab/cli)

   To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

   ``` bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

   ``` bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

   Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

   You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

   ---

   ## Set up your Teams development tenant

   A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where your upload and test your custom app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

   ### Check for custom app upload option

   After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Custom app upload is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you will not be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

   Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

   Verify if you can upload a custom app in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps**.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a customised app**. If the option is visible, you've enabled custom app upload.

        :::image type="content" source="~/toolkit/toolkit-v4/sbs-v4/images-sbs/sbs-gs-msgext/upload-custom-app-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a customised app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you don't have the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

   ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

   If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
   1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
   1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
   1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

       :::image type="content" source="~/toolkit/toolkit-v4/sbs-v4/images-sbs/sbs-gs-msgext/microsoft-365-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 developer subscriptions.":::

   1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

   ## Get a free Azure account

   If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

   Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to do first.


- title: Create project workspace for your message extension app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You've built your bot app. Now, let's create your first message extension app.

    Message Extension capability lets you interact with a web service. Use the compose area, command box, or a messaging in Teams client to search and initiate actions in an external system.

      :::image type="content" source="~/toolkit/toolkit-v4/sbs-v4/images-sbs/sbs-gs-msgext/your-helloworld-app-msgext-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the different types of app featues and message extension is highlighted.":::

    There are two types of Teams **message extensions**:

    - [Search commands](~/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command.md): You can search external systems. Then, you can insert its results into a message in the form of a card.
    - [Action commands](~/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command.md): You can present your users with a modal pop-up to collect or display information. Then, you can process their interaction and send information back to Teams.

    Let's create a message extension app with a *search command*. Use it to search for external data and insert the results into a message within Teams client.

    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the message extension app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Message extensions rely on bots to provide a dialog between the user and your code.

        As message extension apps rely on bots for enabling communication between the user and the web service,, your app loads in to a chat feature of a bot.

        - If you've created a bot app before you created the message extension app, you can see that it's loaded in the same bot app you created. Previous chat messages are visible.
        - If you created a message extension first, your app is loaded in any chat that is open on Teams.

    ### Test your app

    The first time your app loads, the message extension app is open for you to test. This sample app lets you search open-source npm packages from the software registry.
    
    #### To run a search query

    1. Let's enter a search string in the search box, such as "cli". You'll get a list of the matching items:

    You've learned to create, build, and run Teams app with Message Extension capabilities. The final step is to deploy your app on Azure.

    Let's deploy the first app with Tab capability on Azure using Teams Toolkit.

    ## Sign in to your Azure account

    Use this account to access the Microsoft Azure portal and to provision new cloud resources to support your app.

    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/viscode)

    1. Open Visual Studio Code.
    1. Open the project folder in which you created the tab app.
    1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="~/toolkit/toolkit-v4/sbs-v4/images-sbs/sbs-gs-msgext/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon-v4.png"::: icon in the sidebar.
    1. Select **Sign in to Azure**.

        > [!TIP]
        > If you have the Azure Account extension installed and are using the same account, you can skip this step. Use the same account as you're using in other extensions.

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account.
    1. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials.
    1. Close the browser when prompted and return to Visual Studio Code.

        The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar shows the two accounts separately. It also lists the number of usable Azure subscriptions available to you. Ensure you have at least one usable Azure subscription available. If not, sign out and use a different account.

        Now you're ready to deploy your app to Azure!

        Congratulations, you have created a Teams app! 
        Now let's go ahead and learn how to deploy one of the apps to Azure using the Teams Toolkit.

    # [Command line](#tab/cline)

    1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login m365
        ```

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

    2. Sign in to Azure with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login azure
        ```

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

        The account logins are shared between Visual Studio Code and the TeamsFx CLI.

        Congratulations, you have created a Teams app! 
        Now let's go ahead and learn how to deploy one of the apps to Azure using the Teams Toolkit.

      <details>
      <summary>Learn what happens when you deployed your app to Azure</summary>

      Before deployment, the application has been running locally:

      * The backend runs using **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
      * The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

      Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription, and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code for the application to Azure.

      * The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services, including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
      * The frontend application will be deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.

    You've done it!

    You've created a message extension app.

    Now that you've learned to create a basic app, you can move on to creating more complex apps. To start with, try adding capabilities to your existing apps.

    To add capabilities to your existing app:

    1. Select **Add feature** from the **Development** section of the Teams Toolkit sidebar.

    1. Select the capability you want to add to your app.

    That's it! Teams Toolkit adds the scaffolding for the new capability to your app's directory structure. Follow the procedures to build and deploy the app, and your app will have multiple capabilities. 

    You've completed the tutorial to build messaging extension app with JavaScript.
