# Customize app manifest for Visual Studio

:::zone pivot="visual-studio-v17-7"

The app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) describes how your app integrates into Teams and is shared between local and remote environments. The default app manifest file is available at the `appPackage/manifest.json` file and the environment variables available from the `env/.env.{env}` file

The app manifest file contains some environment variables with the `${{XX_XX}}` format. You can define your own environment variables and add placeholders in the `manifest.json` file. The following are the .env and .json file examples:

```env
TEAMS_APP_DESCRIPTION=This is an amazing app
```

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.16/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
    "manifestVersion": "1.16",
    "description": {
        "short": "${{TEAMS_APP_DESCRIPTION}}",
        "full": "Full description of tab0418"
    },
}
```

## Preview app manifest file

You can preview the app manifest file either **For Local** or **For Azure**.  To preview the app manifest file, follow these steps: To preview the app manifest file:

1. Select **Project** > **Teams Toolkit**.

1. Select **Prepare Teams App Dependencies** or **Provision in the Cloud...** to generate environment variables for local or remote Teams app.

## Customize app manifest in Teams Toolkit

Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio loads app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) from `manifest.template.json` with configurations from `state.{env}.json` and `config.{env}.json` while provisioning and preparing app dependencies. You can also create Teams app in Developer Portal with app manifest.

After scaffolding, in the app manifest template file under `templates/appPackage` folder,
`manifest.template.json` is shared between local and remote environment.

In the app manifest template, select **Project** > **Teams Toolkit** > **Open Manifest File**.

### Customize app manifest in Teams Toolkit

The following list provides two types of placeholders in `manifest.template.json`:

* `{{state.xx}}` is predefined placeholder, whose value is resolved by Teams Toolkit defined in `state.{env}.json`. It's recommended not to modify the values in `state.{env}.json`.
* `{{config.manifest.xx}}` is customized placeholder, whose value is resolved from `config.{env}.json`.

You can add a customized parameter by:

* Adding a placeholder in `manifest.template.json` with pattern: `{{config.manifest.xx}}`.
* Adding a config value in `config.{env}.json`.

    ```JSON
        {
            "manifest": {
            "KEY": "VALUE"
            }
    }
    ```

## Preview app manifest in Teams Toolkit

You can preview values in app manifest in two ways:

* When you hover over the placeholder in `manifest.template.json`, you can see the values for **dev** and **local** environment.

   :::image type="content" source="images/vs-hover-placeholder1-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example showing when you hover over placeholder, can view the values for dev and local environment." lightbox="images/vs-hover-placeholder1-v4.png":::

* You can also hover over the key beside each placeholder in `manifest.template.json`, where you can see the same values for **dev** and **local** environment.

   :::image type="content" source="images/vs-hover-key-placeholder-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example showing when you hover over key beside placeholder can view the same values for dev and local environment." lightbox="images/vs-hover-key-placeholder-v4.png":::

If the environment hasn't been provisioned, or the Teams app dependencies haven't been prepared, it indicates that the values for the placeholder haven't been generated. You can follow the guidance inside the hover to generate corresponding values.

## Preview app manifest file

You can either upload your custom app for local, or deploy for Azure to preview the app manifest file. You can preview the app manifest file by performing the following steps:

1. Select **Project** > **Teams Toolkit**.

1. Select to trigger **Prepare Teams App Dependencies** or **Provision in the Cloud** that generates configuration for either for local or remote Teams app.

   :::image type="content" source="images/vs-preview-manifest1-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example of showing the preview app manifest file." lightbox="images/vs-preview-manifest1-v4.png":::

There are two ways to upload zip app package before you can preview the app manifest file:

1. From the list of menu select, **Project** > **Teams Toolkit**.

1. Select **Zip App Package**, then select either **For Local** or **For Azure**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/vs-zip1-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example of showing the navigation to zip app package for local and Azure." lightbox="images/vs-zip1-v4.png":::

1. You can also upload zip app package from **Solution Explorer** section, if you right-click on **MyTeamsApp1**. In this scenario, the project name is MyTeamsApp1.

1. Select **Teams Toolkit** > **Zip App Package** > **For Local** or **For Azure**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/vs-solution-explorer1-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example of showing the list of Teams toolkit menus from solution explorer." lightbox="images/vs-solution-explorer1-v4.png":::

Teams Toolkit generates the zip app package, the following steps help to preview the app manifest file:

1. Right-click on **manifest.template.json** file under **appPackage** folder.

1. Select **Preview Manifest File** > **For Local** or **For Azure**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/vs-preview1-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example of showing the preview app manifest menu for local and Azure." lightbox="images/vs-preview1-v4.png":::

This displays the preview of the app manifest file in Visual Studio.

## Sync local changes to Developer Portal

After you've previewed the app manifest file in Visual Studio, you can sync the local changes to Developer Portal.

Select **Project** > **Teams Toolkit** > **Update Manifest in Teams Developer Portal**.

:::image type="content" source="images/vs-update-manifest1-v4.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example of showing the navigation to update app manifest in Teams developer portal." lightbox="images/vs-update-manifest1-v4.png":::

You can also sync the local changes to Developer Portal from the context menu of **Solution Explorer** section. After the local changes are synced, you can preview the app manifest file in Developer Portal.

:::image type="content" source="images/vs-update-manifest2-v4.png" alt-text="Update manifest in Teams developer portal from solution explorer section":::

The changes are updated to Developer Portal.

> [!TIP]
