# Teams AI library quick start guide

> [!NOTE]
>
> Teams AI library is available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

Get started with Teams AI library using the **ChefBot** sample. It's designed to quickly run a Teams AI library based sample on your computer's localhost.

## Set up your development environment

To get started, ensure that you have the following tools:

* Microsoft Teams
* [Teams Toolkit](../../../toolkit/install-Teams-Toolkit.md)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) key
* Global Administrator access to a [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program?ocid=MSlearn&WT.mc_id=m365-16105-cxa) and [Enable custom Teams apps and turn on custom app uploading](../../../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)

## Build and run the sample app

1. Go to the [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/js/samples).

1. Clone the repository to test the sample app.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai.git
   ```

1. Run the following command to go to the app folder:

   ```bash
   cd samples/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot
   ```

1. Update the **SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY** in the `.env.local.user` configuration file.

   ```text
    SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI key>
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you’re cloning the [ChefBot sample](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/js/samples) through Teams Toolkit, you’ll find the `.env.local.user` file in the setup that is created automatically. If the file isn't available, create the `.env.local.user` file and update the OpenAI key to get started.

1. Go to **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Select **Open a folder**, browse to the folder where ChefBot is available and then select **Select folder**.

1. From the left pane, select **Teams Toolkit**.

1. Under **ACCOUNTS**, sign in to the following:
   * **Microsoft 365 account**
   * **Azure account**

1. To debug your app, enter **F5**.

   A browser tab opens a Teams web client requesting to add the bot to your tenant.

1. Select **Add**.

   A chat window opens.

1. In the message compose area, @mention **TeamsChef-local** to invoke the bot and chat in a plain language.

   The bot uses the text-davinci-003 model to chat with Teams users and respond in a polite and respectful manner, staying within the scope of the conversation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're building a bot for the first time, it's recommended to use Teams Toolkit extension for Visual Studio code to build a bot, see [Build your first bot app using JavaScript](../../../sbs-gs-bot.yml).
