# Get started with Teams AI library

> [!NOTE]
>
> Teams AI library is available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

Teams AI library streamlines the process to build intelligent Microsoft Teams applications by using the AI components.  It provides APIs to access and manipulate data, as well as a range of controls and components to create custom user interfaces.

You can easily integrate Teams AI library, prompt management, and safety moderation into your apps and enhance the user experience. It also facilitates the creation of bots that uses an OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI to provide an AI-driven conversational experience.

## Initial setup

Teams AI library is built on top of the Bot Framework SDK and uses its fundamentals to offer an extension to the Bot Framework SDK capabilities. As part of initial setup, it's important to import the Bot Framework SDK functionalities.

> [!NOTE]
> The adapter class that handles connectivity with the channels is imported from [Bot Framework SDK](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#the-bot-adapter&preserve-view=true).

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot/src/index.ts#L9)

```typescript
// Import required bot services.
// See https://aka.ms/bot-services to learn more about the different parts of a bot.
import {
    CloudAdapter,
    ConfigurationBotFrameworkAuthentication,
    ConfigurationServiceClientCredentialFactory,
    MemoryStorage
} from 'botbuilder';

const botFrameworkAuthentication = new ConfigurationBotFrameworkAuthentication(
    {},
    new ConfigurationServiceClientCredentialFactory({
        MicrosoftAppId: process.env.BOT_ID,
        MicrosoftAppPassword: process.env.BOT_PASSWORD,
        MicrosoftAppType: 'MultiTenant'
    })
);

// Create adapter.
// See https://aka.ms/about-bot-adapter to learn more about how bots work.
const adapter = new CloudAdapter(botFrameworkAuthentication);

  ```

### Import Teams AI library

Import all the classes from `@microsoft/teams-ai` to build your bot and use the Teams AI library capabilities.

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot/src/index.ts#L64)

```typescript
///// Teams AI library /////

// import Teams AI library
import { Application, ConversationHistory, DefaultPromptManager, DefaultTurnState, OpenAIModerator, OpenAIPlanner, AI } from `@microsoft/teams-ai`;
import path from "path";
```

## Create AI components

Add AI capabilities to your existing app or a new Bot Framework app.

**Planner**:  A planner is a function that accepts a user's request and generates a strategy to fulfill it. The planner is the primary component that invokes the Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. The OpenAI API is driven by an array of models, each with unique capabilities. For your specific use case, you might make minor customizations to our original base models.

**Prompt manager**: The prompt manager manages prompt creation. It calls functions and injects  from your code into the prompt. It copies the conversation state and the user state into the prompt for you automatically.

**Moderator**: A moderator adds safety moderation to the input and output. It allows you to identify the user input, flag prompt injection techniques, review the output from the bot, and run it through a business logic for filtering to ensure that the bot complies with OpenAI's usage policies. You can either moderate the input or the output, or both. OpenAI moderator is the default moderator.

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot/src/index.ts#L70)

```javascript
// Create AI components
const planner = new OpenAIPlanner({
    apiKey: process.env.OpenAIKey!,
    defaultModel: 'text-davinci-003',
    logRequests: true
});
const moderator = new OpenAIModerator({
    apiKey: process.env.OpenAIKey!,
    moderate: 'both'
});
// You can also modify this to out the `chatGPT` prompt.
const promptManager = new DefaultPromptManager(path.join(__dirname, '../src/prompts/chat'));

The `defaultModel` type `text-davinci-003` can perform any language task with better quality, longer output, and consistent instruction.

```

## Define storage and application

The application object automatically manages the conversation and user state of your bot.

* **Storage**: Create a storage provider to store the conversation and the user state for your bot.

* **Application**: The application class has all the information and bot logic required for an app. You can register actions or activity handlers for the app in this class.

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot/src/index.ts#L82)

```javascript
// Define storage and application
const storage = new MemoryStorage();
const app = new Application<ApplicationTurnState>({
    storage,
    ai: {
        planner,
        moderator,
        promptManager,
        prompt: 'skprompt',
        history: {
            assistantHistoryType: 'text'
        }
    }
});
```

The `MemoryStorage()` function stores all the state for your bot. The `Application` class replaces the Teams Activity Handler class. You can configure your `ai` by adding the planner, moderator, prompt manager, default prompt and history. The `ai` object is passed into the `Application`, which receives the AI components and the default prompt defined earlier.

## Prompt

Prompts are pieces of text that can be used to create conversational experiences. Prompts are used to start conversations, ask questions, and generate responses. The use of prompts helps reduce the complexity of creating conversational experiences and make them more engaging for the user.

The following are a few guidelines to create prompts:

* Provide instructions, examples, or both.
* Provide quality data. Ensure that there are enough examples and proofread your examples. The model is usually smart enough to see through basic spelling mistakes and give you a response, but it also might assume that the input is intentional and it might affect the response.
* Check your prompt settings. The temperature and top_p settings control how deterministic the model is in generating a response.  Higher value such as 0.8 makes the output random, while lower value such as 0.2 makes the output focused and deterministic.

Create a folder called prompts and define your prompts in the folder. When the user interacts with the bot by entering a text prompt, the bot responds with a text completion.

* `skprompt.txt`:  Contains the prompts text and supports template variables and functions. Define all your text prompts in the `skprompt.txt` file.
  
* `config.json`: Contains the prompt model settings. Provide the right configuration to ensure bot responses are aligned with your requirement. Configure `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and other properties to pass into OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot/src/prompts/chat/config.json)

   ```json
   {
    "schema": 1,
    "description": "Chat with Santa Clause",
    "type": "completion",
    "completion": {
      "max_tokens": 150,
      "temperature": 0.9,
      "top_p": 0.0,
      "presence_penalty": 0.6,
      "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
      "stop_sequences": [
        "Human:",
        "AI:"
      ]
    }
   }
   ```

### Query parameters

The following table includes the query parameters:

|**Value**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|`max_tokens`     | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens can't exceed the model's context length.        |
|`temperature`    | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 makes the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 makes it more focused and deterministic.        |
|`top_p`    |An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. Therefore, 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.         |
|`presence_penalty`     |  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.       |
|`frequency_penalty`     |Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.         |
|`stop_sequences`     |  Up to four sequences where the API stops generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence. |

### Prompt actions

Plans let the model perform actions or respond to the user. You can create a schema of the plan and add a list of actions that you support to perform an action and pass arguments. The OpenAI endpoint figures out the actions required to be used, extracts all the entities, and passes those as arguments to the action call.

```text
    The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. 
    The AI is Santa Clause and the Human is a child meeting Santa for the first time. 
    The AI should always reply the way Santa would. 
    The AI should always greet the human the way Santa would, ask them their name, and then what they would like for Christmas.
    
    {{$history}}
    Human: {{$input}}
    AI:
  ```

### Prompt template

Prompt template is a simple and powerful way to define and compose AI functions using plain text. You can use prompt template to create natural language prompts, generate responses, extract information, invoke other prompts, or perform any other task that can be expressed with text.

The language supports features that allow you to include variables, call external functions, and pass parameters to functions. You don't need to write any code or import any external libraries, just use the curly braces {{...}} to embed expressions in your prompts. Teams parses your template and execute the logic behind it. This way, you can easily integrate AI into your apps with minimal effort and maximum flexibility.

* ``{{function}}``:  Calls a registered function and inserts its return value string.​

* ``{{$input}}``:  Inserts the message text. It gets its value from state.temp.input.

* ``{{$history}}``: Inserts the conversation history.​ It gets its value from state.temp.history.

* ``{{$state.[property]}}``: Inserts state properties.

## Actions

Actions are atomic functions that are registered to the AI Module and serve as the fundamental building blocks of a plan. Actions allow you to define the specific tasks your app will perform and are pivotal in executing plans and enhancing your application's functionality. For instance, you might want your app to create a list, send a message, or perform a calculation. By creating and registering actions, you can control these behaviors and enhance your app's functionality.

### Register Action Handlers

Action handlers assist users in accomplishing their intended goals. One of the key aspects in action handlers is that you must first register the actions in the prompts and then help user achieve the goal.

Ensure you register a handler for every action specified in the prompt. You can use the app.ai.action method to register an action. You can use the `app.ai.action` method to register an action.

In the following light bot example, the actions `LightsOn`, `LightsOff`, and `Pause` are present. Each time an action is invoked, it returns either true or false. If a handler returns false, it stops the planner from executing further `DO` or `SAY` commands. If the bot encounters an unknown action, it is instructed to terminate that action.

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai.c.actionMapping.lightBot/src/index.ts#L107)

```javascript
// Register action handlers
app.ai.action('LightsOn', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
    state.conversation.value.lightsOn = true;
    await context.sendActivity(`[lights on]`);
    return true;
});

app.ai.action('LightsOff', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
    state.conversation.value.lightsOn = false;
    await context.sendActivity(`[lights off]`);
    return true;
});

app.ai.action('Pause', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, data: TData) => {
    const time = data.time ? parseInt(data.time) : 1000;
    await context.sendActivity(`[pausing for ${time / 1000} seconds]`);
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time));
    return true;
});

// Register a handler to handle unknown actions that might be predicted
app.ai.action(
    AI.UnknownActionName,
    async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, data: TData, action: string | undefined) => {
        await context.sendActivity(responses.unknownAction(action || 'unknown'));
        return false;
    }
);
```

### Moderation

`FlaggedInputAction` and `FlaggedOutputAction` are the built-in action handlers to handle the moderator flags.  When a moderator flags an incoming message input, the system redirects the moderator to the `FlaggedInputAction` handler. The `context.sendActivity` then dispatches a message to the user, notifying them about the flag.

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai.a.teamsChefBot/src/index.ts#L97)

```javascript
app.ai.action(AI.FlaggedInputActionName, async (context: TurnContext, state: TurnState, data: TData) => {
    await context.sendActivity(`I'm sorry your message was flagged: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
    return false;
});

app.ai.action(AI.FlaggedOutputActionName, async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, data: TData) => {
    await context.sendActivity(`I'm not allowed to talk about such things.`);
    return false;
});
```
