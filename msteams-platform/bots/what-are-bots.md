# Build bots for Teams

A bot is also referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot. It's an app that runs simple and repetitive tasks by users such as customer service or support staff. Everyday use of bots include, bots that provide information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. Interactions with bots can be quick questions and answers or complex conversations.

It's recommended to start with [build your first bot app using JavaScript](../sbs-gs-bot.yml) or [build notification bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml) by using the new generation development tool for Teams. For more information, see [Teams Toolkit overview](../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md).

> * Bots are available in [Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC-High, and Department of Defense (DOD)](~/concepts/app-fundamentals-overview.md#government-community-cloud) environments. Bot applications within Microsoft Teams for GCC-High and DOD are available through [Azure bot Service](/azure/bot-service/how-to-deploy-gov-cloud-high) and bot channel registration must be done in Azure Government portal.

> * Image URLs in Adaptive Cards aren't supported in GCC-High and DOD environments. You can replace an image URL with Base64 encoded DataUri.

> * When a user changes the Teams theme in a bot, the theme doesnâ€™t apply to the content shared using an Adaptive Card.

Conversational bots allow users to interact with your web service using text, interactive cards, and task modules.

Conversational bots are incredibly flexible. Bots can handle a few basic commands or complex tasks that involve artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Bots can be part of a larger application or be standalone.

Use the right mix of cards, text, and task modules to create a useful bot. The following image shows a user conversing with a bot in a one-to-one chat using text and interactive cards.

Every interaction between the user and the bot is represented as an activity. When a bot receives an activity, it passes it on to its activity handlers. See [bot activity handlers](~/bots/bot-basics.md).

Bots are apps that have a conversational interface. You can interact with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot behaves differently in a channel or group chat conversation and in a one-to-one conversation. Conversations are handled through the Bot Framework connector. See [conversation basics](~/bots/how-to/conversations/conversation-basics.md).

Your bot requires contextual information, such as user profile details to access relevant content and enhance the bot experience. See [get Teams context](~/bots/how-to/get-teams-context.md).

You can send and receive files through the bot using Graph APIs or Teams bot APIs. See [send and receive files through the bot](~/bots/how-to/bots-filesv4.md).

Rate limiting is used to optimize bots used for your Teams application. To protect Teams and its users, the bot APIs provide a rate limit for incoming requests. See [optimize your bot with rate limiting in Teams](~/bots/how-to/rate-limit.md).

With Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings, Teams apps can now interact with users using voice and video. See [calls and meetings bots](~/bots/calls-and-meetings/calls-meetings-bots-overview.md).

You can use the Teams bot APIs to get information for members of a chat or team. See [changes to Teams bot APIs for fetching team or chat members](~/resources/team-chat-member-api-changes.md).

## Add SSO authentication to your conversation bots

You can add single sign-on authentication to your conversation bot using the following steps:

* [Create Teams conversation bot](../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml)
* [Configure your bot app in Microsoft Entra ID](~/bots/how-to/authentication/bot-sso-register-aad.md)

<!--- TBD: For quick scanning, see if the above information can be itemized as a list.

## Bot configuration experience

Bot configuration experience helps the users to interact with the bot in Teams. Users can interact with the bot either by sending a message or selecting a command from the command list. After the bot is installed in a channel or team, all the members from the channel or team can provide inputs to the bot at the same time, the bot only considers the last input provided by the user. For more information, see [bot configuration experience](how-to/bot-configuration-experience.md).
